## Features

Some notable items for this project are:
    - A toggle switch to show/hide the high scores
    - Dynamic button control to prevent buttons from being used at inappropriate times.
    - High Score data is stored on local computer to allow that user to come back later to try to score even better.
    - A button to clear high scores from local storage if desired.
    - Some silly/dad jokes in a couple of the answer options.
